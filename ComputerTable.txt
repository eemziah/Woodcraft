Wood might be oak, table should be 4' x 24". I have two 4' x 7" boards. Once glued together will be 4' x 14". 

Still need another 10".

Was thinking of outlining with pine to give a nice look.

Thinking of applying a nice clear stain to the table. 

Table top is ready to be planed and sanded down, need a design for the base that the top will rest on. Was thinking for something similar to that of the ref picture
